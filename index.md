<h2 id="who-am-i">WHO AM I?</h2>
<p>I am an Associate Professor at <a href="https://www.edu.uwo.ca/">Western University’s Faculty of Education</a>. I completed my PhD in Comparative Education at the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe">Institute of Education, University College London.</a></p>
<h2 id="my-research-profile">MY RESEARCH PROFILE</h2>
<p>I have a long-standing commitment and passion for teaching and research in comparative and international education. My recent research has focused on the complex ways that international service learning (ISL) shapes university students as global citizens. I’ve also produced an edited book (2015) on the impact of ISL on host communities and envisioning more mutually beneficial ways to engage host communities in planning and facilitating ISL programs, especially in Global South settings. My most recent book, <a href="https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781137533449">Internationalization of Higher Education: An Analysis through Spatial, Network and Mobilities Theories</a> (2016) brings together my interest in post-foundational theories and global processes of higher education internationalization. I’m interested in pushing the boundaries about how we think about the effects of globalizing processes within educational contexts, and challenging taken-for-granted assumptions about how we (should) conduct our research and play out our roles as academics within internationalized and corporatized universities. I hope you will join me in continuing this exciting line of higher education research, drawing upon various post-foundational theories and methodologies, to better understand the complex and sometimes contradictory effects of internationalization on students, faculty and members of the wider community.</p>
